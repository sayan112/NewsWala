# Hi, I'm Sayan ! 👋 this is NewsWala 📰
We understand you don’t have time ⏰ to go through long news articles everyday. So we cut the clutter and deliver them, in 60-word shorts. Short news for the mobile📱generation.


## Features

- Read latest news with Newswala in less than 60 words, related to business, sports, bollywood and technology in India and around the world
- Live news update 
- Fullscreen mode
- Dark Mode 



## Important Note 
For some reason, News API only works on mozilla browsers in free plan other than that - News api doesn't allow you to fetch the api from a deployed site. You can fork this repo and run in your local server and add your apikey in config.js file in the root.
deeply sorry for the inconvenience 😢
